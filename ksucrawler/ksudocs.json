With approximately 13-14 tailored core courses, students explore\n                                    their interests and acquire new perspectives. Transfer students from other USG institutions\n                                    can apply previously earned credits toward Core IMPACTS requirements, expediting their\n                                    path to a KSU degree.\nCore IMPACTS Curriculum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed Help? Get Help.\nWith resources from academic assistance to health and emergencies, these resources\n                                    will allow you to get the immediate help and assistance you need at KSU.\n\n\n\n\nSee Something, Say Something.\nKSU seeks to foster a proactive climate of care that can only be achieved through\n                                    cooperative input from the entire community. We connect concerns with the resources\n                                    to succeed and help to prevent crises.\n\n\n\n\nCampus Maps\nKennesaw State University includes two main campuses in Cobb County about 20-30 minutes north of Atlanta, GA. No matter where you choose to visit us, we hope you’ll love Kennesaw State University as much as we do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Advising\n\nAdvisors assist you in identifying and achieving your academic, career, and personal\n                                    goals. They provide academic guidance in order to keep you on track for graduation\n                                    and can help connect you to campus programs and services. You are assigned an academic\n                                    advisor, or advising center, based on your intended major.\nWe encourage you to meet with your advisor at least once each semester. Advising is\n                                    not registration! You should meet with your advisor prior to the date you register\n                                    for classes so you can discuss the best plan for the upcoming semester and beyond.\nAcademic Advising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I find out who my advisor is?\n\n\n\nYou are assigned an advisor based on your intended major. Exploratory/undecided students\n                                                   are seen by Owl Advising, and students who have a major already identified are seen\n                                                   by the advisors in that department. In many cases, your advisor will be viewable in\n                                                   DegreeWorks. You can find more advising information by visiting https://advising.kennesaw.edu/who.php\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I know when it’s time to register each semester?\n\n\nThe best way to plan ahead is to access the phased registration dates on the Registrar’s site. If these are not up to date, you can also click on the academic calendar to view\n                                                many important dates for the University including the beginning and ending of each\n                                                phase of registration. The first available time for you to register can be found by\n                                                logging into Owl Express.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I change my major?\n\n\nYou can change/declare your major in Owl Express under the “student records” tab in Owl Express.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat classes are required for my major?\n\n\n\nEach major has a specific list of required classes for graduation. Current KSU students\n                                                   should check DegreeWorks for this list.\nDegreeWorks is a web-based tool through Banner Web that provides real-time information\n                                                   on degree progression. DegreeWorks lists the courses you are required to take to complete\n                                                   your degree at KSU. This is available to you 24/7.\nLogin to Owl Express (enter your KSU ID & Pin) Select the Student menu. Select DegreeWorks – Degree Audit.\nYour declared major worksheet will automatically load. There is also a “WHAT-IF” tab that gives you an unofficial view of how your credits will apply to a different major. (NOTE: If you officially change your major, you will be moved to the most recent Catalog regardless of when you started classes at KSU.)\nDegreeWorks does not replace face to face advising. You should continue to meet with\n                                                   your advisor to discuss degree-related concerns. Prospective students should contact\n                                                   the major department of interest for degree information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I find out about financial aid?\n\n\nInformation on financial aid, including loans, FAFSA, Hope, and work-study opportunities,\n                                                can be found online at the KSU Financial Aid site.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I find out about scholarship opportunities?\n\n\n\nYour department may be aware of additional scholarships related to your field of study.\n                                                   In addition, the KSU library contains books with information with various scholarships and grants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there someone I can talk to about different career options?\n\n\nThe Department of Career Planning and Development would be a great place to start. Additionally, the Counseling and Psychological Services Center conducts career and academic counseling.

No matter where you choose to visit us, we hope you’ll love Kennesaw State University as much as we do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Success\n\nPossessing computer skills and feeling comfortable online does not necessarily ensure\n                                    your success in an online course. A common theme in online courses is self-discipline\n                                    and persistence. At Kennesaw State, we are committed to helping our online students\n                                    achieving their academic best.\nOnline Student Success\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of online learning?\n\n\n\nOnline learning provides considerable freedom, allowing students to often choose when and where they'll participate in class activities. \n\nSave time and money spent commuting to a campus\nContinue working at your current job while you are taking classes\nAttend your class from anywhere as long as you have a high-speed Internet connection\nLearn at your own pace and study at your convenience\nLearn new technologies\nInteract on equal footing\n\nStudents will have the same kinds of deadlines and structured responsibilities of\n                                                   a face-to-face class. In other words, flexibility must be balanced by responsibility.\n                                                   Like a face-to-face course, online courses require assignments be completed by due\n                                                   dates, your attendance (via logins to your course), involvement in online discussions,\n                                                   and sometimes group collaboration. Most students enjoy the active learning that online\n                                                   classes involve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the challenges of online learning?\n\n\n\nSelf-motivation and discipline are required to succeed in distance learning courses.\n                                                   For many, distance learning offers access to education not previously available. It\n                                                   also provides a solution to flexibility needs, work and travel responsibilities, and\n                                                   family challenges.\nA successful experience in distance learning requires a basic familiarity with technology. Resources are available for students through University Information Technology Services for those interested in distance learning, but in need of a technology refresher. It is also strongly recommended that students have ready access to a computer or laptop with a high-speed Internet access, such as DSL or cable broadband. Online courses will require students to download and access course materials. Online learning success depends on preparation, motivation, dedication, and planning. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat equipment and technology will I need to be successful at online learning? \n\n\n\nOnline learners will need a computer, Internet access, basic software (such as Microsoft\n                                                   Office Suite, Windows Media Player, Quicktime movie player, anti-virus protection\n                                                   and a compatible browser), and auxiliary equipment (such as a webcam and microphone\n                                                   headset for video-based communication). Of course, technology needs will vary by course.\n                                                   But this list applies to the majority of courses.\n\nComputer: Online Learners will need reliable access to a desktop or laptop computer that has\n                                                      adequate memory and processing capabilities for large file downloads, video players,\n                                                      and synchronous meeting applications.\nAuxiliary Equipment: The Digital Learning Innovations team also strongly recommends a WebCam and Headset\n                                                      for video-based communication. Many newer laptop or monitor set-ups are pre-equipped.\n                                                      These items may be required by faculty on a course-by-course basis.\nInternet Access: Online courses at KSU use the web to deliver courses at a distance. So, to learn\n                                                      in an online course smoothly, you need a high-speed Internet connection (such as DSL,\n                                                      Broadband, etc). This is especially important to the online learning experience.\nSoftware: While this will vary by course, you will need a recent version of the Microsoft Office\n                                                      Suite. Access to MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS Excel are expected and necessary for\n                                                      viewing course material or completing assignments. Additional requirements include\n                                                      anti-virus protection, Windows Media Player, QuickTime movie player, and a compatible\n                                                      browser. Visit UITS Training for additional information on software training, compatibility,\n                                                      and available downloads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHAVE MORE QUESTIONS?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIND YOUR INTEREST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture & Construction Management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing & Software Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineering & Engineering Technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHonors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumanities & Social Sciences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth & Human Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional Education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience & Mathematics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Info\n\n\n\nKennesaw Campus1000 Chastain RoadKennesaw, GA 30144\nMarietta Campus1100 South Marietta PkwyMarietta, GA 30060\nCampus Maps\n\n\nPhone470-KSU-INFO(470-578-4636)\nkennesaw.edu/info\nMedia Resources\n\n\n\n\n\nResources For\n\n\nCurrent Students\nOnline Only Students\nFaculty & Staff\nParents & Family\nAlumni & Friends\nCommunity & Business\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links\n\n\n\n\nLibraries\nHousing\nFinancial Aid\nDegrees, Majors & Programs\nRegistrar\nJob Opportunities\n\n\n\n\nCampus Security\nGlobal Education\nSustainability\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow KSU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636)\n© 2024 Kennesaw State University.

If the course section offers a waitlist, consider waitlisting\n                                                      for the course.\nClosed course overrides are available only during the drop/add period. Students may\n                                                      inquire to the academic department and/or the college/school website responsible for\n                                                      the course that is closed.
