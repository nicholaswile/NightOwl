The Know More, Borrow Less (KMBL) initiative supports the USG’s three primary objectives: graduate more students, be more affordable and be more efficient. This initiative is designed to reduce barriers to aid, improve students’ understanding of borrowing and reduce student debt.\nTo support this initiative, a “debt letter” will be electronically sent in a mobile-friendly format to every enrolled student who currently has student loan debt resulting from federal or state loan programs, or private lender borrowing. Students will receive both a text and an email providing them a link to a personalized letter containing specific information on monthly payments based on their current loan amounts. Each academic year, students will receive a debt letter, updating them on their cumulative student loan debt. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid will have analytics to review the open rate of these messages to ensure students are receiving the information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Info\n\n\n\nKennesaw Campus1000 Chastain RoadKennesaw, GA 30144\nMarietta Campus1100 South Marietta PkwyMarietta, GA 30060\nCampus Maps\n\n\nPhone470-KSU-INFO(470-578-4636)\nkennesaw.edu/info\nMedia Resources\n\n\n\n\n\nResources For\n\n\nCurrent Students\nOnline Only Students\nFaculty & Staff\nParents & Family\nAlumni & Friends\nCommunity & Business\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links\n\n\n\n\nLibraries\nHousing\nFinancial Aid\nDegrees, Majors & Programs\nRegistrar\nJob Opportunities\n\n\n\n\nCampus Security\nGlobal Education\nSustainability\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow KSU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636)\n© 2024 Kennesaw State University.

Exploratory/undecided students\n                                                   are seen by Owl Advising, and students who have a major already identified are seen\n                                                   by the advisors in that department. In many cases, your advisor will be viewable in\n                                                   DegreeWorks. You can find more advising information by visiting https://advising.kennesaw.edu/who.php\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I know when it’s time to register each semester?\n\n\nThe best way to plan ahead is to access the phased registration dates on the Registrar’s site. If these are not up to date, you can also click on the academic calendar to view\n                                                many important dates for the University including the beginning and ending of each\n                                                phase of registration. The first available time for you to register can be found by\n                                                logging into Owl Express.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I change my major?\n\n\nYou can change/declare your major in Owl Express under the “student records” tab in Owl Express.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat classes are required for my major?\n\n\n\nEach major has a specific list of required classes for graduation. Current KSU students\n                                                   should check DegreeWorks for this list.\nDegreeWorks is a web-based tool through Banner Web that provides real-time information\n                                                   on degree progression. DegreeWorks lists the courses you are required to take to complete\n                                                   your degree at KSU. This is available to you 24/7.\nLogin to Owl Express (enter your KSU ID & Pin) Select the Student menu. Select DegreeWorks – Degree Audit.\nYour declared major worksheet will automatically load. There is also a “WHAT-IF” tab that gives you an unofficial view of how your credits will apply to a different major. (NOTE: If you officially change your major, you will be moved to the most recent Catalog regardless of when you started classes at KSU.)\nDegreeWorks does not replace face to face advising. You should continue to meet with\n                                                   your advisor to discuss degree-related concerns. Prospective students should contact\n                                                   the major department of interest for degree information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I find out about financial aid?\n\n\nInformation on financial aid, including loans, FAFSA, Hope, and work-study opportunities,\n                                                can be found online at the KSU Financial Aid site.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I find out about scholarship opportunities?\n\n\n\nYour department may be aware of additional scholarships related to your field of study.\n                                                   In addition, the KSU library contains books with information with various scholarships and grants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there someone I can talk to about different career options?\n\n\nThe Department of Career Planning and Development would be a great place to start. Additionally, the Counseling and Psychological Services Center conducts career and academic counseling. Finally, your advisors can help you see\n                                                how your undergraduate major can lead you to many different careers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFIND YOUR INTEREST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture & Construction Management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing & Software Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineering & Engineering Technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHonors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumanities & Social Sciences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth & Human Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional Education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience & Mathematics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Info\n\n\n\nKennesaw Campus1000 Chastain RoadKennesaw, GA 30144\nMarietta Campus1100 South Marietta PkwyMarietta, GA 30060\nCampus Maps\n\n\nPhone470-KSU-INFO(470-578-4636)\nkennesaw.edu/info\nMedia Resources\n\n\n\n\n\nResources For\n\n\nCurrent Students\nOnline Only Students\nFaculty & Staff\nParents & Family\nAlumni & Friends\nCommunity & Business\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links\n\n\n\n\nLibraries\nHousing\nFinancial Aid\nDegrees, Majors & Programs\nRegistrar\nJob Opportunities\n\n\n\n\nCampus Security\nGlobal Education\nSustainability\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow KSU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636)\n© 2024 Kennesaw State University.

A common theme in online courses is self-discipline\n                                    and persistence. At Kennesaw State, we are committed to helping our online students\n                                    achieving their academic best.\nOnline Student Success\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of online learning?\n\n\n\nOnline learning provides considerable freedom, allowing students to often choose when and where they'll participate in class activities. \n\nSave time and money spent commuting to a campus\nContinue working at your current job while you are taking classes\nAttend your class from anywhere as long as you have a high-speed Internet connection\nLearn at your own pace and study at your convenience\nLearn new technologies\nInteract on equal footing\n\nStudents will have the same kinds of deadlines and structured responsibilities of\n                                                   a face-to-face class. In other words, flexibility must be balanced by responsibility.\n                                                   Like a face-to-face course, online courses require assignments be completed by due\n                                                   dates, your attendance (via logins to your course), involvement in online discussions,\n                                                   and sometimes group collaboration. Most students enjoy the active learning that online\n                                                   classes involve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the challenges of online learning?\n\n\n\nSelf-motivation and discipline are required to succeed in distance learning courses.\n                                                   For many, distance learning offers access to education not previously available. It\n                                                   also provides a solution to flexibility needs, work and travel responsibilities, and\n                                                   family challenges.\nA successful experience in distance learning requires a basic familiarity with technology. Resources are available for students through University Information Technology Services for those interested in distance learning, but in need of a technology refresher. It is also strongly recommended that students have ready access to a computer or laptop with a high-speed Internet access, such as DSL or cable broadband. Online courses will require students to download and access course materials. Online learning success depends on preparation, motivation, dedication, and planning. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat equipment and technology will I need to be successful at online learning? \n\n\n\nOnline learners will need a computer, Internet access, basic software (such as Microsoft\n                                                   Office Suite, Windows Media Player, Quicktime movie player, anti-virus protection\n                                                   and a compatible browser), and auxiliary equipment (such as a webcam and microphone\n                                                   headset for video-based communication). Of course, technology needs will vary by course.\n                                                   But this list applies to the majority of courses.\n\nComputer: Online Learners will need reliable access to a desktop or laptop computer that has\n                                                      adequate memory and processing capabilities for large file downloads, video players,\n                                                      and synchronous meeting applications.\nAuxiliary Equipment: The Digital Learning Innovations team also strongly recommends a WebCam and Headset\n                                                      for video-based communication. Many newer laptop or monitor set-ups are pre-equipped.\n                                                      These items may be required by faculty on a course-by-course basis.\nInternet Access: Online courses at KSU use the web to deliver courses at a distance. So, to learn\n                                                      in an online course smoothly, you need a high-speed Internet connection (such as DSL,\n                                                      Broadband, etc). This is especially important to the online learning experience.\nSoftware: While this will vary by course, you will need a recent version of the Microsoft Office\n                                                      Suite. Access to MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS Excel are expected and necessary for\n                                                      viewing course material or completing assignments. Additional requirements include\n                                                      anti-virus protection, Windows Media Player, QuickTime movie player, and a compatible\n                                                      browser. Visit UITS Training for additional information on software training, compatibility,\n                                                      and available downloads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHAVE MORE QUESTIONS?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIND YOUR INTEREST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture & Construction Management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing & Software Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineering & Engineering Technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHonors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumanities & Social Sciences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth & Human Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional Education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience & Mathematics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Info\n\n\n\nKennesaw Campus1000 Chastain RoadKennesaw, GA 30144\nMarietta Campus1100 South Marietta PkwyMarietta, GA 30060\nCampus Maps\n\n\nPhone470-KSU-INFO(470-578-4636)\nkennesaw.edu/info\nMedia Resources\n\n\n\n\n\nResources For\n\n\nCurrent Students\nOnline Only Students\nFaculty & Staff\nParents & Family\nAlumni & Friends\nCommunity & Business\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links\n\n\n\n\nLibraries\nHousing\nFinancial Aid\nDegrees, Majors & Programs\nRegistrar\nJob Opportunities\n\n\n\n\nCampus Security\nGlobal Education\nSustainability\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow KSU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636)\n© 2024 Kennesaw State University.

The grant is part of the NSF's Racial\n                                    Equity in STEM Education initiative (EDU Racial Equity) and the grant is entitled,\n                                    \"The Accessible Calculus Project: Advancing Equity by Democratizing Access to Advanced\n                                    Mathematics\". The work is a collaboration between Kennesaw State University, the Algebra\n                                    Project, Inc., and the National Society of Black Engineers.\nThe project aims to raise the level of quantitative literacy for all High School students\n                                    in two different schools, one in Georgia and one in New Jersey, by adding calculus\n                                    concepts along with computational literacy modules to the Algebra II curriculum. Thesis\n                                    done through an innovative \"Polynomial Calculus\" approach pioneered by the Algebra\n                                    Project, which involves teaching integrals and derivatives using familiar algebraic\n                                    concepts that are already part of the Algebra I and Algebra II curriculum.\nThis project will be addressing the fact that many students never see calculus concepts\n                                    in High School because they don't get to the AP Calculus course level. By exposing\n                                    more students to some of the big ideas in calculus during their high school experience,\n                                    the hope is more students will have access to STEM careers that require it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Your Degree\n\n\nKSU offers 190+ bachelor’s, master’s, doctoral degrees and programs.

We apologize for any inconvenience but know that the adjusted ceremonies will ensure that each student and their guests will have an enjoyable experience during their commencement ceremony. Students who have petitioned by the deadline will receive an email from Marching Order with the date and time of the ceremony in which they are to participate in.\nIf you wish to refrain from shaking hands, as you cross the stage after receiving\n                           your diploma cover, please signal so by placing your hand over your heart. \nIt is strongly encouraged that graduates do not bring many personal belongings to\n                           check-in.

After graduation, I was able to join a young and rapidly-growing cybersecurity firm in the Atlanta area, which allowed me to quickly jump into the world of consulting. This was all thanks to connections I formed during my time at KSU. I've since been able to grow into a full-time career as a penetration tester and red teamer, helping organizations secure their critical assets and helping to reduce business risk.\nMy experiences from the CYBR program have been extremely valuable during this entire process. The technical and managerial concepts taught in the courses aided me in multiple real-world settings and projects. Additionally, I’d argue that the extracurricular opportunities at KSU, such as the Offensive Security club and SECCDC competition, are key differentiators for the program, and are nearly equal to the value of an entire undergraduate degree in themselves.\nIf you are local to the Atlanta area, it’s also worth noting the extremely advantageous location that KSU possesses. The Atlanta technology sector is growing rapidly, with many large organizations in the city seeking talented individuals from universities like KSU.\n\n\n\n\nMadison Loewe, BS in Cybersecurity Class of 2021\nKennesaw State University alumna Madison Loewe graduated summa cum laude in Spring\n                                    2021. For her graduating class, she was recognized as the Cybersecurity Student of\n                                    the Year. This honor had been noticed by Risk3sixty, and they reached out to Loewe\n                                    about an interview. While going through the interview process, she noticed that she\n                                    enjoyed talking to the team and reading their content online and determined that this\n                                    was the place for her. Soon after, Loewe was an Associate at Risk3sixty and worked\n                                    within the GRC space with their SOC 2 team. The material she had learned throughout\n                                    her college journey had been integral to understanding the work she would be doing\n                                    and preparing her to face the challenges of cybersecurity. In her role, she is continuously\n                                    learning and growing as she interacts with many aspects of the cybersecurity field,\n                                    from configurations to vendor management to penetration test reports, with many different\n                                    business models. By April of 2022, she had been promoted to Senior Associate. Since\n                                    then, Loewe has published content related to the SOC 2 attestation process, begun\n                                    participating in a book club for professional development, and been studying for certifications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Connected to Center for Cybersecurity Education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIND YOUR INTEREST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture & Construction Management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing & Software Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineering & Engineering Technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHonors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumanities & Social Sciences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth & Human Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional Education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience & Mathematics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Info\n\n\n\nKennesaw Campus1000 Chastain RoadKennesaw, GA 30144\nMarietta Campus1100 South Marietta PkwyMarietta, GA 30060\nCampus Maps\n\n\nPhone470-KSU-INFO(470-578-4636)\nkennesaw.edu/info\nMedia Resources\n\n\n\n\n\nResources For\n\n\nCurrent Students\nOnline Only Students\nFaculty & Staff\nParents & Family\nAlumni & Friends\nCommunity & Business\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links\n\n\n\n\nLibraries\nHousing\nFinancial Aid\nDegrees, Majors & Programs\nRegistrar\nJob Opportunities\n\n\n\n\nCampus Security\nGlobal Education\nSustainability\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow KSU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636)\n© 2024 Kennesaw State University.

Through his research, he will develop data-driven insights that guide the creation of cost-effective and sustainable cancer treatment protocols.\n\n\n\nHis research partnership was sparked by a conversation with a colleague familiar with\n                     the National Institute of Kenya and their mission. This connection led to a collaborative\n                     opportunity with the NCI of Kenya and is driven by Ray's passion for improving cancer\n                     care outcomes.\n\"After looking at data, it became clear that Kenya's healthcare system was different from the U.S. in many ways,\" Ray said. \"They have a socialized healthcare system, and for each patient in their cancer registry, there’s corresponding claims data, which is harder to find in the U.S. This data is crucial for understanding how factors like access, delays, and policy affect outcomes.\"\nKSU College of Computing and Software Engineering  dean Sumanth Yenduri commended Ray on his insightful research.\n“Dr. Ray’s research is meaningful and impactful,” Yenduri said. “I congratulate him on landing this grant which will now give CCSE researchers the opportunity to contribute and provide solutions to improve treatment access.”\nThe research focuses on both direct and indirect costs, such as medication, hospitalization,\n                     and financial barriers, to understand how these factors impact Kenyans. The project\n                     is expected to run through 2025.\n“We’re analyzing everything from the cost of delayed treatments to the effectiveness of outpatient versus inpatient care,” Ray said. “Ultimately, we aim to identify treatment protocols that improve survival rates and are sustainable within Kenya’s healthcare system.”\nAnother focus of the research is the financial strain that impacts a patient’s compliance to treatment. Many patients are forced to prioritize basic needs like food and housing over medical care, leading to delayed or skipped treatments, which can worsen their health.\n“In Kenya, as in the U.S., cost concerns often delay treatment,” Ray said. “But in cancer, delays can lead to disease progression and higher costs later on. We’re studying the timing of treatments to understand their impact on both cost and survival.”\nRay’s research also looks to provide evidence-based insights that could shape policies and improve resource allocation for cancer care in Kenya.\n“We hope this data will help Kenyan policymakers make informed decisions on how to assign resources effectively and give residents the timely care they need,” he said.\nThe long-term vision for the project is to train the next generation of data scientists,\n                     particularly those from Kenya, to build local expertise in healthcare data analysis.\n                     By providing hands-on experience and mentorship, Ray hopes to empower students to\n                     take ownership of the research, ensuring the sustainability and continuation of the\n                     work even after the project ends.\n“Involving students is key,” Ray said. “We want to train Kenyan students in data science methods and have them take ownership of this research in the future. By doing this, the residents of Kenya will be in good hands for years to come.”\nKennesaw State master’s and Ph.D. students are playing an important role in the project. Their involvement covers all areas from contributing to the study design, analyzing data, and proposing new research directions. This offers real-world practice and application of the academic training.\nRay’s work has global implications, as the lessons learned in Kenya could inform cancer care in other developing nations. He hopes to apply these findings to improve healthcare systems worldwide, particularly in areas where resources are scarce.  \n“If we can make a difference in Kenya, we can apply similar strategies in other countries facing similar challenges,” Ray said.\nStory by Raynard Churchwell\nPhoto by Matthew Yung\n\n\n\n\nRelated StoriesKennesaw State researchers take big steps in obesity research with NIH grantKennesaw State researcher earns NIH grant to investigate health factors related to obesity using AIKennesaw State assistant professor awarded Georgia Research Alliance grant to advance groundbreaking diabetes researchKennesaw State and Go Studio launch research project to improve consumer shopping experienceA leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its more than 47,000 students.

The Walens’ gift propels Kennesaw State to having secured $28.2 million of $30 million necessary for the Athletics Capital Campaign, which is a prominent component of the $200 million Campaign for KSU.\n                     Donna and Dave Walens\nThe Campaign for KSU is the most comprehensive fundraising effort in the university’s history. The Campaign is inspiring student success at KSU through scholarships and support programs, strengthening multidisciplinary research initiatives, and expanding academic and athletic facilities. “This transformative gift from Dave and Donna Walens will help fund state-of-the-art facilities, empowering KSU to excel at the highest levels of competition in Conference USA,” said Kennesaw State President Kathy S. Schwaig. “Their generosity creates a lasting legacy, elevating the student-athlete experience, fostering both academic and athletic excellence, and fueling our momentum as a university on the rise.” Previously, the Walens family was one of the first donors to the Legacy Locker initiative supporting The Owls Fund, the fundraising arm of KSU Athletics. Legacy Locker donors purchase the naming rights\n                     to a locker in one of the home locker rooms inside Fifth Third Stadium, the Convocation\n                     Center, Mickey Dunn Stadium, and Bailey Park, with all proceeds going toward resources\n                     and programs for KSU student-athletes. Dave Walens’ contributions to Kennesaw State have included one of the most recognized symbols on the Kennesaw Campus – the iconic black and gold sculpture of the university’s “KS” mark on the Campus Green. Walens, the CEO and president of Exploring, Inc., commissioned his company to design, build, and install the more than 10-foot logo sculpture which was unveiled in 2020. “Dave and Donna have been lifelong philanthropists, and they inspire me personally and so many people in Owl Nation with their giving heart and giving spirit,” KSU Director of Athletics Milton Overton said. “They already have made a historical mark at Kennesaw State with the donation of the ‘KS’ on the Green, and now their family legacy will live on forever through this contribution.” At a signing ceremony for their $4 million commitment to KSU Athletics, Dave and Donna\n                           Walens are pictured with President Kathy S. Schwaig, KSU Foundation CEO Lance Burchett,\n                           and Director of Athletics Milton Overton.\nWalens began his involvement with Kennesaw State by serving on, and eventually chairing,\n                     the advisory board for the Robin and Doug Shore Entrepreneurship and Innovation Center in the Michael J. Coles College of Business. That led to his nomination to the KSU Foundation Board of Trustees, which he is\n                     serving on for his sixth year.\n“Donna and I are grateful to play a role in supporting a university that has given so much to so many and to help ensure its legacy of excellence continues for generations to come,” Dave Walens said. “Kennesaw State University is more than just an institution to me — it’s a place where potential becomes possibility, where students and student-athletes alike are given the resources to grow, achieve, and lead.”\n\n\n\n\nRelated StoriesKennesaw State biology student studies links between soil and tree healthKennesaw State researcher earns NSF grant to study urban amphibians, create undergraduate research opportunitiesKennesaw State researchers take big steps in obesity research with NIH grantFirst-generation student follows physics curiosity to Kennesaw StateA leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its more than 47,000 students.

Similar to Valero’s revolutionary GlucoCheck device, which is a non-invasive blood glucose monitoring system, the app would allow people to better monitor their day-to-day eating habits through artificial intelligence (AI). \n                     El Arbi Belfarsi and Afnan Ahmed Crystal\n\n\n“We are trying to build an app to complement the GlucoCheck device, allowing users to input relevant information, take a simple picture with their smartphone, and obtain an estimate of the nutritional content using AI. This estimate will be used to analyze the impact on blood glucose in tandem with the GlucoCheck device. We believe the app could empower people to make better decisions about nutrition.” said Crystal, who will graduate next month with her Master of Science in Computer Science.  \nA key component of the application is its use of AI. That’s where Belfarsi’s expertise in large language models (LLMs) comes into play. Originally employed as a data analyst at a trading firm, he developed an interest in LLMs and sought to apply his expertise to health informatics systems. He saw the potential for AI to help people make better decisions about nutrition. \n“Large language models are primarily designed for processing textual data,” said Belfarsi, who is pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science. “When dealing with images, they rely on additional layers like the Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, which is trained to match images with their textual descriptions. Therefore, when prompting for nutritional data, we are effectively leveraging external computer vision models that complement the LLM's capabilities.” \nValero credits the two students with combining their expertise and addressing potential pitfalls, such as regional cuisines that could potentially generate ethnic bias in the delivery of accurate information. The app has also been made to adjust feedback according to portion sizes. It’s all part of the Internet of Things as a Service Research Group's goal of helping people live healthier lives through applied technology.  \n“Next, we're going to give the application to people, ask them to use our continuous glucose monitor, and collect data,” Valero said. “With that data, we will be able to do a model for an individual prediction of how your glucose is going to behave. Beyond that, the app can prescribe other habits like exercise to mitigate lifestyles and other factors.”\nThe project does not intend to replace the role of a dietician or nutritionist, but\n                     to augment the human element with a useful app that anyone can use. Future versions\n                     of the app might consider exercise habits chronicled through wearable technology like\n                     Fitbits or Apple Watches.\n“The main goal is to benchmark whether the LLMs can outperform a dietician's evaluation, or vice versa,” Crystal said. “The second one is to leverage AI for better nutrition decision-making and improve people’s lives. We plan to integrate other wearable devices and push personalized data from these wearables to AI to improve its responses.” \nThe Nutrilyzer is in an early testing stage with a possible launch this spring.\nStory by Dave Shelles\nPhoto by Matt Yung\n\n\n\n\nRelated StoriesKennesaw State researchers take big steps in obesity research with NIH grantKennesaw State researcher earns NIH grant to investigate health factors related to obesity using AIKennesaw State assistant professor awarded Georgia Research Alliance grant to advance groundbreaking diabetes researchKennesaw State and Go Studio launch research project to improve consumer shopping experienceA leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its more than 47,000 students.

Once you see the world through the eyes of people who think and feel differently than you do, you can build understanding and relationships that impact the world. We offer 79 study abroad programs in 35 countries and have a permanent education site\n                                    in Montepulciano, Italy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho will you become?\n\nChoosing a college is not only about where you will spend the next few years studying.\n                           It is about finding a place that speaks to you authentically and allows for your growth\n                           and belonging. More than a name on a diploma, your college choice should reflect your\n                           values, passions, and aspirations. At KSU, we believe in surrounding you with the\n                           resources and people who can inspire, challenge, and support you in becoming the best\n                           version of yourself -- personally, academically, and professionally.

Since then, we have continued to approve messages and publish to the online version of KSU Today. Unfortunately, due to additional changes, the KSU Today platform will be eliminated completely on March 31, 2023.  \nInternal communications are important to keeping the KSU community connected, which is why we have been working to find alternative solutions. We are currently in the process of finalizing new tools to enhance communications within the University and will share updates as soon as they are available. \nMeanwhile, there are several ways you can still share information and stay informed: \n\nKSU Events Calendar: The calendar is accessible via the KSU homepage. Using your NetID and password, you can publish any type of event to the calendar. Additionally, you can opt in to receive a customized weekly digest of events, which will be delivered directly to your email. \n\n                           \nVisit calendar.kennesaw.edu and log in. \nClick on the arrow next to the avatar in the upper right-hand corner. \nSelect Settings and click on Communications. \nClick on Digest and follow the directions on the page to set up a customized email. \n\n\nOwl TV: OwlTV is the KSU digital signage network. It is available for University-wide content\n                           and delivers messages to more than 150 digital signs across the Kennesaw and Marietta\n                           campuses, and it is a great way to promote your event or activity. For more information\n                           please review the submission guidelines.\nNews from the Nest: This is the University’s monthly electronic newsletter sent via KSU Announcement to all faculty and staff on the last day of the month. News from the Nest includes links to several newsletters with information from departments such as HR, facilities, IT, emergency management and fiscal services.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Info\n\n\n\nKennesaw Campus1000 Chastain RoadKennesaw, GA 30144\nMarietta Campus1100 South Marietta PkwyMarietta, GA 30060\nCampus Maps\n\n\nPhone470-KSU-INFO(470-578-4636)\nkennesaw.edu/info\nMedia Resources\n\n\n\n\n\nResources For\n\n\nCurrent Students\nOnline Only Students\nFaculty & Staff\nParents & Family\nAlumni & Friends\nCommunity & Business\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links\n\n\n\n\nLibraries\nHousing\nFinancial Aid\nDegrees, Majors & Programs\nRegistrar\nJob Opportunities\n\n\n\n\nCampus Security\nGlobal Education\nSustainability\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow KSU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636)\n© 2024 Kennesaw State University.
